Arrays

how do you track multiple values in programming?

let's say that you are tracking 3 peoples names. How would you do so?
"""

# this won't work as it 
name = "zach"
name = "thomas"
name = "stewart"
print(name)

# this will allow us to record each name by storing each in a different variable
name1 = "zach"
name2 = "thomas"
name3 = "stewart"

# but must call each name by the variable,
print(name1)
print(name2)
print(name3)

# this solution is not expandable or maintainable
# solution? store multiple values in one variable
